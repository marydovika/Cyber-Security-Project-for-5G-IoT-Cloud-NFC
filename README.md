1.1BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
The development in IoT (Critical and Massive) and Cloud Computing (deployment and service model) have raised the need for a network the can seamlessly support these services, 5G is both cloud native and support critical/ massive IoT.  2G, 3G and 4G where not developed for these future QoS demands. The major enablers for 5G are; cloud computing and IoT. 5G is on trial in most parts of Africa, including Uganda, as per the time of carrying out this research (2018). There are four fundamental requirements for a modern communication network, which include, Data rate/throughput capacity, processing power of network equipment, Functional Redundancy and ether channels, and most importantly cyber-security, all of which contribute to QoS Realization. Security of huge amounts of data (big data) on 5G, IoT, and Cloud computing networks, should be handled with great concern. Due to the rise of cybercrimes, the field of cyber security has grown in the recent years, with well-defined Common Body of Knowledge (CBK)[ https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Common-Body-of-Knowledge-CBK], and approaches. 

1.2PROBLEM STATEMENT
The increasing demands for real-time communication/ streaming 4k videos, gaming , VR, MR and AR and IoT (smart home,  smart grid, smart city, v2x) that put a constraint on traditional storage, raising need for cloud computing. The data on a network includes personal health data, agriculture, education, e-government, e-commerce including, the increasing electronic money transfers etc., with the effort of the government to digitize all communication. All these services, and efforts generate huge amounts of data, Big-data, this poses a problem ensuring cyber security. I have singled out cyber-security to be the focus of this paper. The security of data on the network both in transit, and in cloud has to be handled with great concern. 5G is proposed to be rolled-out by 2020, I advocate for a secure architecture, by reviewing the security frameworks and models. 

1.3OBJECTIVES
1.4GENERAL OBJECTIVE
To carry out Cyber security evaluation and mitigation for future wireless networks, 5G for IoT and cloud computing networks.

1.4.1Specific Objectives
To carry out research on cyber security risk management, models, frameworks, and roadmaps, encryption and authentication algorithms of wireless networks, and Access control models.
To carry out research on 5G, IoT and Cloud network architecture.
To develop two MATLAB Applications; one that hinds the characters of a password on login and implements minimum login requirements , and another that generates munged passwords to ensure  password  hardening and perform network security hardening and monitoring.
To carry out research on cyber security policies both national and international.

1.5PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND PROJECT SIGNIFICANCE
The two major enablers for 5G are NFV, and SDN, and is the ideal network for IoT and cloud computing networks. The network virtualization and softwarization introduces new attack vectors that will require different Countermeasures. Therefore, it is worth it, to review the proposed 5G security architecture. Uganda is currently in 5G trial stages. Most start-ups  are implementing cloud systems, and IoT systems, like automation of different activities in health, agriculture, power grid, government( CCTV public  surveillance cameras)  and mobile banking/mobile money and education(e-learning platforms ) all of which require a fast connectivity achieved by 5G cellular networks. Security of data should be ensured, hackers can cost a company a great deal of money, reputation, and test its competence to protecting the information of its customers [check: case, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack]

1.5.1Project Significance
This study will create a practical understanding of cyber security, policies and practices that include Computer security, Security  Systems Software  Development  Life Cycle (secSDLC), and Network security for the future wireless networks (IoT and Cloud)

1.6RESEARCH QUESTIONS
